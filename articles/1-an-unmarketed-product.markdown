I&rsquo;ve really found it hard to have a personal website, I&rsquo;ve been creating things on the web since I was a teenager and for the last 6 years professionally - but when it comes to my own site, where I&rsquo;m meant to have my own voice, it&rsquo;s kinda like standing naked in-front of your peers.

I guess I&rsquo;ve always rationalised that the work I do should speak for me, which is fine but historically (and definitely recently), the work I&rsquo;ve been doing has not been noticeably mine. Being a [contract for hire](http://jaseandtonic.com/ "Ruby pirate for hire: Jase &amp; Tonic Ltd"), you don&rsquo;t always get to shout out loud that you did this and that - unfortunately transparency hasn&rsquo;t permeated the psyche of all the agencies across the land.

Whilst I intend be delving deeper into my recent portfolio of work on the upcoming (re)launch of my [company website](http://jaseandtonic.com/ "Jase &amp; Tonic Ltd") I don&rsquo;t intend to talk shop here much. Over the last year my interests have grown outside of the web; Food, [craft beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbrewery) and [cycling](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jase_n_tonic/2893775798/, "picture of my beloved bike") have been battling for my time alongside my lifetime best friend [music](http://last.fm/user/jase_n_tonic "my Last.fm profile").

Hopefully a mix of those things including some titbits of [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "The language choice of a generation") and the like might make something worth while to write about. Although I&rsquo;ve been in this situation a good dozen times, a half hacked website and a promise of some divine content.

In case you are wondering I&rsquo;ve hacked this site together using the sweet little ruby framework [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com "Brilliant web framework that makes you feel like you are writing ruby again"), you can [grab my code off github](http://github.com/jasoncale/jasoncaledotcom/tree/master "Source code for this site - free code is love") and I&rsquo;ve hosted it using [Heroku](http://heroku.com "the instant ruby platform") which seriously rocks. As far as the design goes, I could have gone super modern, and I could have done shit loads of [jquery](http://jquery.com) magic but to be honest I do all that of in the day job. The guy that made me want to leave working in flash and embrace web standards back in 2001 [recently redesigned](http://zeldman.com "The king of web standards") and I was suitably inspired, which you may see in this design, also it gives me a simple platform on which to grow the site.

I&rsquo;ve not got comments or anything yet, partly because I think only spam bot&rsquo;s would be interested in responding, partly because I&rsquo;ve not spent long enough on the code to bother with them, and mostly because of the wise words of local genius [James Adam](http://interblah.net/leave-a-comment "What Dr J thinks..") on commenting - which I&rsquo;m inclined to agree. If you wish to talk about anything, or tell me I&rsquo;m an idiot [@reply me on twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=%40mrjase%20Hey%20jase%2C%20I%27ve%20read%20your%20site%20and%20you%20are%20an%20idiot "Tell it like it is") and tell me what you think. Because if anything I&rsquo;ll probably integrate some kind of twitter commenting system or something.

Onwards!
