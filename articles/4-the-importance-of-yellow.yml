  %h2 The importance of my own brand.

  %p Now first thing is first, this isn't some bullshit diatribe about personal branding and how to get yourself noticed, how to promote your blog or whatever other crap people seem to write about self promotion. I couldn't care less, well of course I do care about my own ego, but I'm arrogant enough to assume I don't need to do anything to make you love me, I certainly don't need to come up with artificial ways to try seduce you.

  %p Ok, now we are back together, let me take a small moment to explain what I mean.

  %p Surrounding yourself with reminders of who you are, and aspire to be is immensely beneficial to keeping on track. A creative endeavour should be traumatic on you, if it isn't then you aren't really doing something with your experience, passion and self belief that you can make everyone else around you look shit. Chances are you are just imitating your surroundings, you are subconsciously fitting in, defining yourself by your peers may get you an invite to a cool party, or make your blog en-vogue - which is something I see everyday, but for most folks we just aren't clever enough to pull that kind of replication off.

  %p Those soulless buggers who talk about self promotion and give you checklists to your own greatness, are the vacuous bleeders who devoid of any real character can make us vulnerable people swoon like flowering teenagers.

  %p The trauma of creating something should be right there in your face, willing you to fail, wanting you to take the easy solution. Sometimes the easy solution is the best one, but often you need to dig in deep and prepare for battle. Giving yourself some identity to hang off even if you never share it with anyone will help you refute those nagging doubts and insecurities when you work.

  %p Just before I designed my company website, I had spent the last few weeks reading a book about copywriting which was yellow. At the time I didn't realise that was where my inspiration was coming from, I didn't even have the book with me as I was at my parents house over the christmas holidays and had nothing else to do on a sunday afternoon than make a site for myself.

  %p The point is that book meant something, it was a step I had consciously made to try and begin writing (or because Sam had been prodding me to start for a couple of months), so it made sense that I had ripped some of the style off for my new identity. First thing I did once I launched the site that evening, other than feel vulnerable was plaster my surroundings with the colours, textures and ideas. My wallpaper on my mac had the logo and strap-line and the bright yellow background - a few days later I bought some yellow teeshirts (although at the time I had no idea why). I felt comfortable with what I had created and I was embracing it. Even now I've setup WriteRoom to be black with yellow text so it feels like its a homogenous part of my brand.

  %p What am I getting at with all this? Well I believe that having a brand or identity you can surround yourself with, you have a canvas to start to try and understand what you are about, what turns you on and most importantly to help let you develop the confidence to be who you are, and push your own ability out into the world instead of just absorbing and reflecting what others do around you.
