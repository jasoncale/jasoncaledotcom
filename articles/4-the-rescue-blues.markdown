I have a bit of a weakness for Ryan Adams, some people agree with me .. others think I've lost my mind.

I don't really care, and I love this version of this song (give it a few seconds to start).

Those who know will recognise it off his country pop wonder album [Gold](http://tinyurl.com/59crxu "Wikipedia entry"), but it's a hell of a lot slower, his voice breaks and its all over the place.

To me it sounds like it was recorded at 4AM, after lots of cigarettes, drunk, slightly too cold .. lights a little low .. everyone moving around slowly. 

Content.

Had plenty of times like that in the past .. I probably should have them again sometime.

Keep in touch baby, and call me with the rescue blues.
