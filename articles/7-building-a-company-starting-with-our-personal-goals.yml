  %h2 Cultivating a collective mind.
  
  %p 
    I'm part of a group of people, together we are building a company called 
    =succeed(".") do
      =link "FreeRange", "http://gofreerange.com", "Software revolutionaries" 
  
  %h4 Introspection, for the good of the company.
  %p One of the nice things about FreeRange is the feeling being part of a group, but that requires learning about and trusting each other. We are currently sharpening our focus on what is important to us as a company, and part of this exercise was to write down our personal viewpoint and goals. 
  
  %p I'd like to share what I wrote down.
    
  %ol
    %li 
      %p I want to simplify my decisions.
    %li 
      %p I want to work on one thing [FreeRange], because I have found that I'm not very good doing multiple things.
    %li 
      %p I want to establish a brand, a cohesive identify I can believe in, tell people about, and give myself to. Other than a group of freelancers, the loose association doesn't make me happy, nor does my singular existence as a freelancer. I have trouble with the term already, I think because my normal inclination is to be drawn into chaos, I prefer to discipline myself.
    %li 
      %p I want to refresh myself regularly, I feel I've stagnated since I left my agency, I used to think I was excellent, now I think I'm coasting as mildly good.
    %li 
      %p I want to belong to something that with my involvement will be greater, yet perhaps more importantly I'm better off because of my involvement within it.
    %li 
      %p I want to work full time, and because of that I will afford myself a set period of sabbatical.
    %li 
      %p I want to share space with others and interact with them on a daily basis, I find this allows me to focus and get inspired.
    %li 
      %p I want to build products, that are great to use, and inspire me to work on, and use daily. 
    %li 
      %p I want to share what I learn with others, and document what I learn, perhaps even publish something.
    %li 
      %p I want to become a better designer, and focus on front end development. Weirdly enough I do like javascript.
    %li 
      %p I want to work with engineers, and I want to establish working practices that will explore the idea of better integrating design into the software process.
    %li 
      %p I've realised that my original idea of allowing ideas to evolve, and prefer an organic approach is actually aversion and delusion of what I perceived to be freedom.
    %li 
      %p I now know that discipline and defined action, which followed through daily is the best way I have found to cultivate freedom and happiness.
    %li 
      %p My wish to travel and live outside of london (I have considered NY, SF, or Japan etc) is really just aversion, and is an attempt to create a focus by removing all other distractions.
    %li 
      %p I want to practice yoga, and meditation everyday, but I feel I can fit this around a structured work day.
    %li 
      %p I want to promote education and share knowledge with younger people, as I believe this will help the web / industry that I work in.
    %li 
      %p I want to be good, mindful of others and I want to learn.
    %li 
      %p I want to learn to live by less money.
