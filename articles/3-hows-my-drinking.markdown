Lucy and I went to stay at my parent's ranch last weekend, partly because they were away and needed their cats looking after, and partly because we wanted to get out of London for a while.

They live on the outskirts of a tiny village in [north norfolk](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=blackborough+end&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=16.680516,39.594727&ie=UTF8&z=15&iwloc=A "Google maps link") (near kings lynn) which apart from being idllic, it has [britain's biggest beer shop](http://www.beersofeurope.co.uk/) a mere five minute drive away. 

I got beers, oh yeah I got beers. Super hoppy, bitter, brutal beer that makes my taste buds explode and my head spin.

However, I'm not going to ramble on about the taste of each of them _yet_.

But dear reader I can tell you that cracking open the [Great Divide beers](http://www.greatdivide.com/#/beer "Titan IPA &amp; Hurcules Double IPA") and a few of the [Stone](http://www.stonebrew.com/ipa/ "Stone IPA") ones, oh and maybe a couple of [Brooklyn IPA's](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/45/147 "Beer advocate review") .. and yes the [double dog](http://www.flyingdogales.com/Beer-Specialty-Doublepale.aspx "Flying Dog - Double Dog") too (clocking in at 11.5% ABV no less!) made for a very enjoyable Saturday evening.

Whilst they were all very nice, I didn't really drink them with a critical head - I just drank them whilst cooking on the bbq and stoking a fire.  
Otherwise known as enjoyment.

So I can recommend them dearly, and I reckon you wanna get yourself some fine american craft beer; grab an order from [beers of europe](http://www.beersofeurope.co.uk/), or even wait until my new secret venture is out in the open!

But until then, I'm off for a cheeky one &amp; a big ol' smile.
