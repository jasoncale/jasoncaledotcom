How can I convince you it's me I don't like  
And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes  
When I've always been distant  
And I've always told lies for love  

I'm bound by these choices so hard to make  
I'm bound by the feeling so easy to fake  
None of this is real  
Enough to take me from you  

Oh I've got reservations  
About so many things  
But not about you  

I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say  
How can I get closer and be further away  
When the truth  
Proves it's beautiful to lie  

Oh I've got reservations  
About so many things  
But not about you  

I've got reservations  
About so many things  
But not about you  

Not about you  
Not about you  
Not about you  

It's not about you
